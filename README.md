# GatsbyWP

A barebones theme for using WordPress as a backend for Gatsby without displaying on WordPress front end.

Includes a function to set empty acf fields to null to prevent graphql query issues on fields that are empty. 

Includes a custom post type called recipes, you can change or remove this however you would like. Or use the example to create more post types without the need for a plugin.
